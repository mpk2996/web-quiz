# Week 4 Homework: Coding Quiz

In this project, my goal was to create a working coding assessment platform. This Challenge involved several multiple choice questions, an introduction page with a start button, a running timer, and a closing "High Scores" page for users to submit their high scores and compare against other submissions.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
